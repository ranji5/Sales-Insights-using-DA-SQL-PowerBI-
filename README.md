I developed a Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard to provide stakeholders with real-time sales insights. 
This dashboard was built using Power BI, which allowed for dynamic data visualization and interactive reporting. 
The project involved extracting and processing data from MySQL databases, utilizing Pandas and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization, and integrating SQLAlchemy for efficient database connectivity. 
The result was a comprehensive dashboard that enabled stakeholders to make informed decisions based on up-to-date sales data.
